The Reserves Tool as seen/used via Canvas


## Mission
To enable Faculty, Reserves Librarians, and Students to manage Course Reserves Lists via Harvard's Canvas app

## Overview

This is a course-level external LTI tool that allows Faculty and Reserves Librarians to create, edit, view, and delete items that should be reserved for that course.

It includes:
  * A Responsive design
  * The ability to quickly insert metadata information about items that are found either in Harvard Library's [HOLLIS+](http://hollis.harvard.edu) discovery system, PUBMED, or that have a Document Object ID that can be found in the [Crossref](http://www.crossref.org) Metadat Services
  
It's built to work with Harvard's instantiation of the [canvas
lms](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms), Harvard Library's Reserves Tool API, and Harvard Library's [PRESTO Data Lookup API](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/LibraryStaffDoc/PRESTO+Data+Lookup).

It takes advantage of the [dce-lti](https://github.com/harvard-dce/dce_lti) gem for managing the interactions between it and Canvas.
